Your choice for web development
### Why?!

We made this website to identify our team and our services
with a brief description about us.
### What?!
 This site contains
* a headline about our team.
* a navigation bar contains "About,Team, and contact".
* a team section describing our team.
* a way to contact us section.
* a footer.
### How?!
We spent 2 days learning how to get this site works nicely!
* We made a wireframe for the site.
* WE divided the website into these sections for each one in the team "each one worked on a different branch with one of the sections below":
 * header
 * nav bar
 * about us
 * Team
 * contact us
 * footer
* We worked with the HTML file.
* then we styled it with CSS.
* We pushed and merged all the branches on github.
* After the merge we faced some issues.
* We divided the issues between us and fixed it.
* We started to make the site responsive.
